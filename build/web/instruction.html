              <font size="4">  Welcome to the Desert Island Task. 
                Next to your computer you’ll find a list of 16 people. <br>
                In this task, you and your partner, <input type="text" id="name" value="Michael" readonly>, another college student, 
                will take turns choosing from the list of people you would want with you if you were stranded on a desert island. <br> 
                To prevent from choosing the same people, you’ll choose from the top 
                half (1 through 8) of the list, and your partner will choose from the bottom half (9 through 16).<br>
                After making a choice, you’ll provide justification for that choice. 
                For example: ‘I’d take Jen. She’s a doctor and would be able to take care of anyone who got sick’.<br>
                In each round, after justifying your own choice, you will see who your partner 
                chose and respond to your partner’s choice and justification 
                (e.g., you might agree with your partner’s reasoning, offer additional 
                reasons why it is a good choice, or explain why you disagree with the choice or the justification.<br> 
                Each of you will see each other’s responses. 
                You each will select three people to take with you. <br><br></font>
